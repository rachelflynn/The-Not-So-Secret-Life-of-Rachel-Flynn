# Getting a credit card is an important decision for a variety of reasons...

Credit cards are a simple way to help build credit. Your credit score impacts your ability to borrow money/request loans (auto loan, mortgage, personal loan, credit card, student loan, etc.), apply for rentals, and some jobs even run credit checks before hiring employees. Building and maintaing a good credit score will help you get approved with (potentially) lower interest rates if you ever need to borrow money in the future. The credit union I used to work at even offered secured credit cards which were perfect for people with no/bad credit. 

Credit cards are essential for me while I am travelling. They remove the hassle of converting cash into local currency or frequently visiting ATMs to withdraw funds using a debit card. Most credit card companies offer very competitive conversion rates, and some do not have any fees for using the card internationally. When I am travelling, I always use my credit card and pay it off immediately* to avoid cash and fees. 

Last but not least, many credit cards offer unbelievable rewards like cash back, free travel, travel credits, lounge access, certain types of insurance, etc. 

*A key component of avoiding credit card debt is only making charges you can afford and paying off the card in full each month. Credit cards can have very hefty interest rates, so be sure to avoid racking up a bill you cannot afford. 

I currently have three cards that I would highly recommend, and they are the Capital One Venture, DiscoverIt, and Wells Fargo Go Rewards. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages which we will discuss below.
