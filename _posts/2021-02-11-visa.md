My previous blog post outlined 9 steps you can take to make your dreams of studying abroad come true. As I briefly mentioned, applying for your study visa is one of the most important steps of the process. You cannot enter the country to study without a valid visa, so you must apply for it ahead of time. 

Visa processing lengths vary, but plan ahead and apply at least **2-3 months** before you intend to travel. Gathering the required documents will also take time on its own, so I would recommend starting that process at least **2 months** before applying. All in all, you should starting preparing **4-5 months** before your program starts. 

Each country has its own set of requirements when applying for visas. You MUST determine what documents you need, where you need to apply, and how much it will cost before applying. Some countries rely on third-party services (like VFS mentioned below), so you may not need to visit the local embassy/consulate. You can usually find how to apply for a visa on the country's government or consulate website. 

I applied at the South African Consulate in Chicago and did not have to go through VFS. The documents were all listed on the VFS or DHA [websites](https://www.vfsglobal.com/dha/southafrica/study-visa-content.html), and I obtained them all on my own. The process itself was very straightforward, but I have compiled a list explaining how I got each document.

This country-specific information can usually be found on the embassy's website. If you are applying for a South African visa, you will definitely need to locate a notary for multiple documents. These can be free, but many usually charge a small fee. Take all of the documents that you need notarized with you at once so you avoid multiple fees. 

*This is not an exhaustive list, so please refer to the website to confirm what documents you need to submit. If you are applying for a visa outside of the US, your requirements may be very different.*

All that said, here are the 17 documents you need to submit for a study visa in South Africa: 

**1. Valid passport**

Every country will require you to have a passport that is valid for the length of your visa. In South Africa, your passport must not expire within 30 days of your visa expiry date. If you are in a multiyear program and your passport is set to expire, they may issue you a visa valid until your passport expires. You would then need to renew your passport and apply for another visa. The easiest option is to make sure your passport will not expire when you intend on being out of the country so you only have to apply for one visa. 

My program was originally two years, but I was informed that I could complete it in one. I was unsure if I should apply for a one or two-year visa, but I would have needed to renew my passport if I wanted to apply for a two-year visa. I decided to choose the safer option and renew my passport before applying for my visa. If you don't have a passport or need to renew yours, you can visit [this page](https://www.usa.gov/passport). The current processing time is 10-12 weeks for regular services or 4-6 weeks for expedited. Make sure you factor this wait into your visa processing timeline if you need to submit a passport application/renewal! 

*Total cost: $120 ($110 fee + $10 shipping label, but [fees can vary](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/fees.html))* 

**2. Notarized copy of my passport bio page**

South Africa requires applicants to submit a notarized copy of their passport bio page. This is the second page in your passport that has your signature, photo, and personal information. Once I had my renewed passport in hand, I made a copy of this page and signed it in front of a notary. I visited my local credit union that offered free notary services for members, so there was no cost for me to get this document. 

*Total cost: $0 (varies)* 

**3. FBI clearance** 

When applying for anything other than a tourist visa, many countries require you to submit some kind of security clearance from each country you have lived in for more than 12 months. In the US, this is known as the Identity History Summary Check. You must fill out a form and submit your fingerprints to receive a report that details your history with law enforcement. You can follow the steps listed [here](https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/identity-history-summary-checks) to submit your application. This usually takes a few weeks, and the results are sent to you electronically. You can also request a paper copy in the mail that will come within 1-2 weeks. 

There are third-party companies that you can hire to complete the process for you, and they usually promise to get you the results quicker. Be very careful when using these companies as many of them are scams (but there are legit ones as well). I chose not to use one because the process was straightforward enough to do it myself, and the results only took about 1 month to arrive. I had a copy of my fingerprints taken at my company, but you can usually get it done at your local police station for a small fee. 

*Total cost: $18* 

**4. South African government application form**

This form is available [online](http://www.dirco.gov.za/madagascar/documents/temp_residence_22072019.pdf) and must be completed to obtain basic information about each applicant. South Africa uses a third party to manage visa applications called VFS. If you apply from a country that also uses VFS, this form must be completed *electronically.* If you apply directly at a South African Consulate, you must submit a *handwritten copy* of the form. 

Make sure you confirm your country's requirements before submitting a visa application because this can impact what documents you need to complete.

*Total cost: $0* 

**5. Two passport photos**

Contrary to popular belief, you do not need to have expensive passport photos taken at your local photo lab. I downloaded an app called [Passport Photo Booth Creator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/passport-photo-booth-creator/id1043990051) to take my photos at home. The app provides you with simple instructions (don't small, use a light-colored background, where to place your face) to ensure that your photo complies with government guidelines. I then downloaded a digital copy and sent them to Walgreens for printing (2x2 inches). I used these photos for both my visa application and passport renewal. 

Make sure you follow the instructions exactly as listed on the application so the photos are not rejected. I took two different photos and sent them both to reduce my chances of rejection. 

*Total cost: $1* 

**6. Flight reservation**

Many countries like to see proof that you will leave the country by the time your visa expires, so you usually have to present a roundtrip ticket. This can be problematic if you are unsure when you will be departing. Thankfully I planned on returning midway through my studies to attend my brother's wedding, so they accepted this ticket as proof of return. 

You can usually print out the booking confirmation to submit with your visa application. 

*Total cost: $900 (varies based on departing airport and arrival airport)* 

**7. Three months of stamped bank statements and 8. Proof of sufficient financial means** 

As a student, the government will probably request proof that you have enough money to cover your daily expenses and tuition without working (though many study visas allow you to work part-time). The amount varies based on the country you want to live in, so make sure you confirm the required amount. For this, I submitted three months' worth of bank statements, my financial aid offer from the university, a copy of my parent's bank statements, and the loan offer I received through the US federal government. 

South Africa is big on stamped documents, and unfortunately, many banks in the US don't have physical stamps. I printed my bank statements at home, and then I took them to my local branch to have an employee sign them. 

*Total cost: $0* 

**9. Notarized letter of parental responsibility** 

I think this requirement is mainly for minors, but I still submitted the document just to be safe. Basically, my parents wrote a letter claiming financial responsibility for me if I did not have enough money (though I planned to use my own money). They both agreed to sign the document, so we went to a notary at our local credit union so they could sign the letter in their presence. 

*Total cost: $0 (varies on notary)*

**10. Certified copies of my parents' IDs**

Along with the notarized letter of parental responsibility, I submitted a notarized copy of each of my parent's driver's license. We made copies of the front and back of each ID, and then we had the document notarized (again at our local credit union). 

*Total cost: $0 (varies on notary)*

**11. Medical report** 

Many countries will require you to have a physical examination completed before travel, or in South Africa's case before you can even apply for your visa. This is to ensure that the applicant will not (hopefully) rely on the local healthcare system too much and to prevent the spread of various diseases. 

I scheduled my annual physical examination with a local doctor, and she agreed to complete the required [form](https://www.vfsglobal.com/dha/southafrica/pdf/medical-report-format.pdf). For South Africa, the examination must be documented on their specific form or else it can not be accepted. This form also needs to be physically stamped by the doctor. My doctor's office did not have any stamps, so I asked the consulate if they could sign the form and attach a business card. They said that this would be a good substitute for a signed form. 

The cost of this obviously varies based on your doctor and health insurance. I scheduled mine as an annual physical examination, so my health insurance covered the entire visit. 

*Total cost: $0 (varies on insurance/healthcare provider)*

**12. Radiological report**

South Africa has a high level of tuberculosis cases, so they require each visa applicant to submit a form completed after a chest x-ray to prove that they do not have TB. After my physician completed the medical report, I told her I also needed a chest x-ray. They completed it in-office and sent the x-ray to be analyzed at a local hospital. After a few days, I got the results back via email. Since I had a physical form that needed to be signed, I called the hospital to see if the person who analyzed my x-ray could sign it. They agreed, so I went to the imaging department at the hospital and provided them with the required [form](https://www.ufh.ac.za/international/assets/radiological-report-form.pdf). The hospital also did not have a physical stamp, so they signed the document and attached a business card. 

Based on how my physician ordered my x-ray, my insurance also covered this charge. 

*Total cost: $0 (varies on insurance/healthcare provider)*

**13. Yellow fever vaccine** 

This item was not required if you have not been in a country with a yellow fever outbreak. I already had the vaccine from when I visited Sierra Leone, so I submitted my vaccination record that was stapled in my passport. 

*Total cost: $0 (varies)* 

**14. Notarized copy of my birth certificate** 

I read [online](https://www.nationalnotary.org/notary-bulletin/blog/2019/07/what-is-vital-record-notarize) that you are not legally allowed to notarize certain government documents. Though South Africa requested a notarized copy of my birth certificate, I submitted the original document to be safe. 

Once you submit documents for processing, you usually do not get them back. This meant that I had to request another copy of my birth certificate from my state.  

*Total cost: $15 (varies state to state)*

**15. Proof of medical cover**

One of the most important documents to submit was proof that I had health insurance/medical aid for the entire duration of my studies. Most insurances do not cover you internationally, and some governments require you to have local insurance. That was the case in South Africa, so I purchased 12 months of cover from Ingwe Momentum. They have a monthly contribution option, but I paid for the whole year of coverage upfront to receive the necessary documents. After I purchased the insurance, they sent me a letter for my application that confirmed that I had medical cover for the duration of my studies. I submitted this letter with my visa application to satisfy this requirement. 

This step was also vital for me because my university required me to submit the same letter before I could even register for my classes. Though it was a large upfront cost, it was definitely worth it. My insurance covered any COVID-related expenses on top of their regular benefits (doctor visits, one dentist visit, and one ophthalmologist visit). My insurance practically paid for itself by the time I completed my studies. 

*Total cost: around $500 (varies)* 

**16. An official letter from my university confirming my place of study**

Once you are accepted into your program, you should immediately reach out to the international student office to obtain the required documents. My university had to provide me with a letter that stated that I was a registered student and that they would notify the government within 30 days if I terminated my studies. I received this letter from one of the staff members in the international student office. It took about 2 weeks to receive the document, so make sure you ask ahead of time.  

*Total cost: $0*

**17. Visa processing payment** 

The final requirement was a visa processing fee of $35. Each consulate will accept different forms of payment, but I submitted a money order with my application. I got this at my local grocery store for $1.

The US does not use a visa processing service (like VFS mentioned above), so I had to drive to my nearest consulate and apply in-person. Though there are at least 3 South African consulates in the US, you must apply at the one that is closest to your state of residence. I had to drive 5 hours to the consulate in Chicago, and I dropped off my application for processing. Since I was not local, I also had to submit a $20 prepaid shipping envelope for them to return my passport. You must submit the label with your return address, and it is a good idea to also purchase some form of insurance since your passport will be in it. 

*Total cost: $56 (varies)* 

The total amount that I spent to get my study visa was **$1,610.** BUT, this included my passport renewal that is valid for 10 years, 12 months of health insurance, and a roundtrip ticket from the US to Cape Town. The visa itself had an extremely low processing fee as I mentioned. 

The upfront cost may be a bit intimidating, but it is definitely worth it! Studying in South Africa has been one of the greatest experiences of my life. Now it's your turn to check what documents you need, submit your visa application, and have the time of your life :)
