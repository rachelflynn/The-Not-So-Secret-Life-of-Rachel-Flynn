Ever since I can remember, I have had the urge to travel all over the world. My parents helped instill this sense of wanderlust as we took a family vacation each year. During spring, summer, or winter break, the five of us would pack up the minivan and hit the road. We traveled near and far, so I had visited over 30 of the 50 states by the time I was 18. I took my first international trip as an early teenager and never looked back. I have now visited 23 countries and counting (COVID-19 depending). I love traveling and dream about making a career out of it. I also have a passion for learning, so I knew I wanted to attend graduate school at some point in my life. 

I decided that the best way to combine my two passions was to attend graduate school abroad. This was also a smart decision financially since grad school in the US is SO EXPENSIVE. I started my search by choosing an area of interest and finding universities all over the world with relevant programs. I also knew I wanted to go somewhere cheap and warm, so I finally decided on the University of Cape Town in Cape Town, South Africa! 

I had visited Cape Town once before on vacation and fell in love with the city. The backdrop of gigantic mountains, the reflection of the blue waves, and the smell of coffee roasting all over town...who could resist?? I submitted my application and returned to the city to visit the university (and sneak in another vacation, of course). And the rest is history :) I have been living in Cape Town for about 11 months now and plan on returning to the US soon. My program consists of one year of coursework and one year for completing a 25,000-word dissertation.

My plans got somewhat derailed when the pandemic struck. South Africa went in lockdown with no international travel for over 6 months, and we were not even allowed to leave our houses (except for food) for 5 weeks. The virus took an extreme toll on the country that was already grappling with high levels of unemployment and racial/economic divides. My university transitioned into Emergency Remote Teaching, but we did not have live classes due to unstable internet access in the country. 

All of this to say, this year has been T O U G H. This pandemic has caused me (and everyone else) to miss out on so many events and gatherings, but I am still grateful to have a nice place to live and the opportunity to finish my degree on time. Once life gets back to "normal", I hope other people still chase their dreams of studying abroad...and I am here to help! SO here is the ultimate list of how to start your journey of studying abroad: 

**1. Choose an area of interest.** 

If you're like me and you have a wide range of interests, it is difficult to narrow down the exact program you want to do. Start by writing down things you like to study, and then you will get a better sense of what areas may be a good fit for you. You should study something that really interests you or something advantageous for your career path. It is so much easier to complete assignments when you are intrinsically motivated. 

You can also choose multiple areas of interest if it is too hard to narrow it down, and then select one when you get further in your search. Whatever you select is not set in stone, but it is required to help you hone in on your ideal program. Create a list of about 3 programs that you would be interested in to help you choose which university you want to attend. 

**2. Search for universities (or specific countries) with similar programs. 

If you have a good idea of the types of programs you would like, you can start by searching for universities that have similar programs. When I was at this step, I searched for high-ranking universities that had the program I wanted. Another way of searching is to filter your options by country. If you have an idea that you want to study in Germany, for example, then you can search for German universities. You can visit their websites to see what programs they offer and determine if it would be a good fit. Google is the best place to start, so just enter where you want to go or what program you want to complete, and VOILA! 

**3. Compare the cost of attending each program.** 

In some countries, the cost of tuition can prevent many people from attending grad school (ahem, I'm looking at you, USA). Some people, including yours truly, choose to go to school outside of the country to save some money. Once I selected a few different universities with programs I liked, I compared the financial aspect of attending each. I looked at a program I really liked in Chicago, but just one year (excluding living costs) reached $40,000. There were TA and scholarship opportunities, but that still was wayyyyy too much for me. I also liked a different program in the UK that would have cost $12,000/year plus living expenses. In the end, my program at UCT was only about $9,000 plus living expenses, and I received lots of financial aid that made it the smartest choice financially. Narrow down your options and determine the cost of attending each school before making any decisions. 

**4. Look into the visa process.** 

Once you decide on a program and a university, I recommend briefly looking into the study visa process. Key items to look for are processing times, where to apply, how much it costs, and what documents are required. When I was looking into the University of Cape Town, I joined a Facebook group that assists with South African visa questions and problems. This group was soooo helpful in answering questions and providing previous member experiences. Check social media for similar groups in the country you want to move to! 

**5. Apply to the school and reach out to the international office.**

All schools have different application requirements, but the main thing to look out for is the international student deadline. They more than likely will have an earlier deadline for international applicants so they have time to apply for their study visas. The university may have an early deadline for scholarships or financial aid as well. Make sure to also check the academic calendar for the year you plan to start because the school may have different timings than you are used to. In South Africa, the academic years usually begin in February since it is in the Southern Hemisphere. I am from the US, so I was used to school starting in August/September and applications due in February/March. Both my admission and scholarship application for international students were due 6 months before registration and 3 months before South African applicants. Keep your eyes peeled for these dates so you do not miss the opportunity to apply. 

**6. Gather documents and submit your visa app.** 

Every country requires different documents for visa applications, so the best place to confirm this information is on your local embassy/consulate's website (you can also call). Common documents may include financial proof, school registration, police clearance, a copy of your insurance/medical aid, and an application form. You should start preparing your visa application at least 6 weeks before submission because it can take some time to obtain some of the required documents. If you do not have a passport or you need to renew yours, you must start a few months in advance to ensure that you get your passport in time. 

I applied for my South African study visa in November 2019, and I was required to submit the following things: passport, notarized copy of my passport bio page, FBI clearance, a South African government application form, two passport photos, flight reservation, three months of stamped bank statements, a notarized letter of parental responsibility, proof of financial means, certified copies of my parents' IDs, medical report, radiological report, yellow fever vaccine, notarized copy of my birth certificate, proof of medical cover, and an official letter from my university confirming my place of study. If you are applying for a South African visa, this is a good list to start with but you also must visit the DHA or VFS website to confirm which documents you need.  

**7. Apply for scholarships or financial aid.**

I highly recommend applying for financial aid or scholarships, even if tuition is much cheaper than in your home country. The first place you should check is your university's financial aid website because they usually post opportunities there. You can also ask the international student office for further opportunities or aid available specifically to international students.  

I found all of the relevant information on my university's financial aid website. They had local, national, and international scholarship/funding opportunities posted with very concise instructions for how to apply. I was awarded an international student scholarship that covered about 1/3 of my tuition for the first year (with the opportunity to renew). I also highly recommend keeping your eyes open for funding opportunities throughout the year. My department posted more funding opportunities about halfway through the school year as well. These two scholarships covered almost all of my remaining tuition, so I only ended up paying about $1,000 for school. 

You can also try applying for scholarships in your home country if they allow international applications. I applied to 3 scholarships in the US, but I, unfortunately, did not get them...but it can't hurt to try! 

**8. Start planning to move!** 

Once you submit your visa, it is a good idea to start planning your move. You will need to decide where you are living, how you will get around town, where to buy your textbooks, what jobs you can do, what to pack, and if you need to open a bank account (amongst many other things). Even if you don't have the outcome of your visa application, you should still start looking into these details to give yourself enough time.  

I joined lots of Facebook groups to do research on living in Cape Town and the city itself. This groups became essential for answering questions about visas and life in general. You can consult blogs and people who share their experience on social media to gain further insight as well. Do your research so you can be prepared when you arrive!  

**9. Catch that flight...** 

Once you have your visa and have sorted out your details, it is time to catch that flight! Sometimes this can be the hardest step in your journey, but in the end, it will be one of the best experiences of your life :)
