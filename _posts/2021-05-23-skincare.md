2020 was a STRUGGLE for everyone as we adjusted to the lockdown life. This meant more time inside, meals at home (BOO), and not socializing with others. For me, this gave me an excuse to spend hours scrolling through Instagram Reels and Tik Tok. That may sound like unproductivity, but I surprisingly spent most of that time learning about skincare. 

Up until this past year, I washed my face maybeeeee once a month? I never applied moisturizer because I believed the common misconception that you shouldn't do that if you have oily skin. All my life I had been told that I had oily skin, but throughout my social media research, I learned that I actually had combination skin (oily in some parts, dry in others). I used the wrong kind of face wash when I did wash my skin, and I cringed while reading the nasty ingredient list after getting woke. 

The endless skincare content I consumed taught me a few things: 

1. **It is worth the money to purchase quality skincare.** and 2. **Ingredients DO MATTER.** These 2 tips go hand-in-hand. I've found that cheaper products, particularly store brands, tend to use more harmful ingredients. It's hard to find the perfect product, but I usually will not buy something if it has more than 3 nasty ingredients. Here is one list you can use for [reference](https://tasty-yummies.com/dirty-dozen-cosmetics-skincare/). I also really like the [INCI Decoder](https://incidecoder.com/) because you can scan a product's barcode, and it will list out each ingredient and rate it on a scale of 1-5. If the product isn't in the system, you can upload a picture of the ingredients and it will do the same.  

3. **Just because someone promotes a holy grail product, it doesn't mean that it will have the same results for you.** Everyone has different skin. Whether it is a different kind of skin (dry, oily, combination), sensitive skin, or skin allergies, each product can cause different reactions. Skincare is really trial and error until you find the perfect products for you. 

4. **Simplicity is bliss.** You do not need a 14-step routine every morning and evening. I use a maximum of 5 products and feel like that is a lot. When starting, my best advice is to get a cleanser, moisturizer, and SPF. You can always incorporate extra steps into your routine once you get in the groove of it, but those 3 ingredients are THE MOST IMPORTANT. 

5. **SPF BABY.** SPF is honestly one of the best anti-aging products you can use. Don't step foot out of your house without it and reapply every 2-3 hours. And yes, you still need sunscreen even if you are indoors. Any exposure to the sun can damage your skin, even through windows. Don't try to fight it...just do it. 

So without further adieu, here is my daily skincare routine!

**Morning**

1. Cleanse my face gently with water. Pat dry and let air dry for a few minutes. 

2. [CeraVe Skin Renewing Vitamin C Serum](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/serums/skin-renewing-vitamin-c-serum): Vitamin C is a key anti-aging ingredient and can help with your skin's radiance and healthy appearance. This serum is 10% pure vitamin C (yes, percentages do matter) and leaves my face with a nice glow after application. 

3. [The INKEY List Caffeine Eye Cream](https://www.sephora.com/product/caffeine-eye-cream-P443840): Dark circles under your eyes appear for a variety of reasons, and caffeine can help if they are from sleep deprivation. This eye cream applies evenly and smoothly, and it will help reduce the appearance of puffiness, bags, and wrinkles. 

4. [Vichy MINERAL 89](https://www.vichyusa.com/skin-care/skin-care-product-type/face-moisturizer/mineral-89-mineral89.html): Don't let the price tag scare you off. This product is WORTH. EVERY. PENNY. This facial is made of hyaluronic acid and provides additional hydration to your face. It's made to strengthen and repair your skin barrier, leaving it smooth and hydrated. 

5. [Unscented Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Gel Face Moisturizer](https://www.target.com/p/unscented-neutrogena-hydro-boost-hyaluronic-acid-gel-face-moisturizer-to-hydrate-and-smooth-extra-dry-skin-1-7oz/-/A-16600134): This is my holy grail moisturizer that I apply both day and night. It helps attract and lock moisture into your face and will leave it feeling extra smooth. Always opt for the unscented option (for any skincare product) to avoid fragrance. 

6. [Eucerin Sun SPF50+](https://clicks.co.za/eucerin_sun-spf50+-gel-creme-oil-control-dry-touch-50ml/p/237521): I have yet to find a sunscreen that I love, but this one comes close. It goes on smoothly and doesn't leave a white cast. It is quickly absorbed into my skin and provides excellent protection from the sun. SPF is a must, especially if you are using retinol. 

**Evening**

1. [La Roche Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Face Cleanser](https://www.laroche-posay.us/face-and-body-skin-care/face-products/face-wash/toleriane-hydrating-gentle-facial-cleanser-tolerianehydratinggentlefacialcleanser.html): This is a great cleanser for dry or combination skin (gel cleansers are better for oily skin). It does a great job of removing makeup and dirt while leaving the skin hydrated.  

2. [The Ordinary Azelaic Acid Suspension 10%](https://theordinary.deciem.com/us/rdn-azelaic-acid-suspension-10pct-30ml.html): Azelaic acid is an underrated skincare ingredient and can help reduce uneven skin texture and blemishes. This one from The Ordinary has a creamy, sticky texture, so I usually wait 1-2 minutes before applying my next step. I usually rotate between azelaic acid, lactic acid, and Differin each night. 

OR

2. [The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA](https://theordinary.deciem.com/us/rdn-lactic-acid-10pct-ha-2pct-30ml.html): When I'm not using azelaic acid, I use lactic acid. This is a mild skin exfoliant that will help unclog your pores. 

OR 

2. [Differin Adapalene Gel 0.1% Acne Treatment](https://www.target.com/p/differin-adapalene-gel-0-1-acne-treatment-15g/-/A-51346324): On the third night of my rotation, I use Differin to help with my hormonal acne. This is a prescription-strength retinoid that will help restore your skin's natural tone and texture. 

3. [The INKEY List Retinol Eye Cream](https://www.theinkeylist.com/products/retinol-eye-cream): Retinol is a key anti-aging ingredient and can help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. This eye cream will help with under-eye bags and wrinkles, and it is to be applied only in the evening. 

4. [Unscented Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Gel Face Moisturizer](https://www.target.com/p/unscented-neutrogena-hydro-boost-hyaluronic-acid-gel-face-moisturizer-to-hydrate-and-smooth-extra-dry-skin-1-7oz/-/A-16600134)

**Random Other Products** 

1. [The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution](https://www.ulta.com/aha-30-bha-2-peeling-solution?productId=pimprod2007102): This is the infamous red facial peel all over Tik Tok. Use this product with caution because misuse can result in serious skin damage...When used correctly, this is a powerful exfoliant that will help unclog your pores and increase your skin's radiance. I use this once a week on clean skin and only leave the mask on for 10 minutes before rinsing it off. 

When you start your skincare journey, research will be your best friend. Some active ingredients that should NEVER be mixed (retinol + vitamin C, for example), and you do not want to cause major damage to your skin. Social media is a great place to start and find new skincare product recommendations. It may take a while to find your staple ingredients, but it is worth it in the end. I have the best skin I've ever had, and I look about 5 years younger! Your future self will thank you when you don't have wrinkles or sun damage ;) 

Until then...peace, love, and SPF!
